    about: New Hope is an international education consulting firm founded in the United States, with office in China.  Company founder graduated from one of the best universities in China and later came to the United States to experience the world's best education. With successful personal learning experience, extensive working experience and life experience in the U.S., years of passion and dedication to the Chinese education and Sino-American culture exchange, he is committed to helping more Chinese students to achieve their America dreams. <br><br>New Hope is a highly responsible, professional, knowledgeable, and caring team.  The core advisers in China have been engaged in the field for many years, have extensive experience in study abroad application and visa counseling, familiar with the U.S. higher education and were invited to the U.S. institution. Our senior advisors in the U.S. have lived here for more than 15 years, with master's or doctoral degree obtained in the United States, and a very deep understanding of American society, culture and education. <br><br>New Hope has partnership with many American universities and high schools, has access to the latest school information such as school admissions policies changes, level of application difficulties, employment opportunities etc., which is not directly accessible to most of the Chinese domestic services.   Especially when various problems may occur in the application process, we can directly get in touch with the school to solve those problems quickly and effectively. Another main feature of our service is that we provide a range of follow-up services after students arrive in the U.S. such as meeting/picking up students in the airport, assisting with accommodation, helping students to register and opening bank and mobile phone accounts, transferring, career guidance and other services.  Nowadays, younger age has become a major trend in study abroad.  We see more and more middle school and high school students coming to the States to study.  While studying here, those students still need guidance and supervision. Our goal is to make our students to feel at home in a foreign land, achieve their dreams and their loved ones in China have no need to worry!<br><br>New Hope's China team has excellent educational background and professional experience, and the U.S. team has a deep understanding of China's state of affairs and cultural values of American society, with our dedication, passion, enthusiasm and patience, together, we will help you to make your dream come true!
